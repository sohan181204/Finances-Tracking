# finances_tracking
This mini project is a finance tracking tool that allocates a user's total salary into different categories like shopping and groceries based on specified percentages. 
It calculates the amount for each category, sums the expenses, and shows the remaining amount after expenditures.
This helps users manage their budget effectively.
